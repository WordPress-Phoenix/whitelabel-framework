<p>We suggest you use the theme installer. Its much smaller to download, automatically renames the folder on your WordPress install for you, always pulls the "most recent stable version" of the theme for you. Once you have the installer, you don't really need to come back here except to look up documentation, features, and tutorials. The installer can be kept locally and used without worry that its every "outdated".

<p>This WordPress theme is a developers framework, also known as a “Parent Theme”. The intention is not to give a bunch of eye candy, instead, the focus is on good a good flexible theme that allows moving fromPSD to WordPress themes in record time.</p>

<p>Beyond that we have a TON of CMS back-office features, of which we will begin to document after we solidify the beta public release on the WordPress.org repository. If your tired of loading the same plugins over and over on all your sites to make them CMS friendly for clients, your going to LOVE this parent theme.</p>

<p>The theme is very light-weight, and as such we are being careful not to “overload” it with a massive set of options. Also, many of the options can be turned off using “PHP Constants”. Look into the functions.php file to see different parts of the framework you can easily turn off completely (PHP pages won’t even by loaded upon disabled constants). </p>

<p>Copy the part.theme-config.inc.php file into your child theme and erase everything. That should disable just about everything, allowing you to reference the part theme config file for anything you want to turn back on.</p>
