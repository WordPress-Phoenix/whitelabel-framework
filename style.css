Description: Whitelabel Framework is designed to be the ideal Parent Theme for child theme development, and for use by freelancers and web developers to easily convert PSD to WordPress child themes. The theme options were built as modules, so turning off theme functionality is easy when you prefer to use a plugin instead.

You should not need to add any styles to this framwork css file, instead create a child theme css file and add your styles there.
