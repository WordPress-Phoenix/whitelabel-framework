= WHITELABEL FRAMEWORK (FOR DEVELOEPRS)=

* by the Sethmatics team, http://sethmatics.com/

== ABOUT WHITELABEL FRAMEWORK ==

The theme was developed and designed to be used as a starting point for all/any other themes. Typically as a developer we have started from 2010 or 2011 themes and modified them to work and look as we needed. The provide functionality that is something more invasive then helpful. 

The goal of this theme is more functionality then aesthetics. So we set up the most basic 960gs, included as many of the WordPress built-in theme options as possible, and we have Boolean constants (on off switches) to disable any files from loading that you don't need or don't want. The first version release will be very basic, and include only a limited number of options. 

As the theme develops, we will take more and more from the plugins that we use on every single website and code them in to be part of the theme. Again, this will be done in modular design, so anything can be turned off to allow you to use a preferred plugin instead of built-in theme functionality. If you're a developer and you're looking for a "Developers Framework" instead of a "Users Framework", well, then you have found the right theme. We are also VERY interested in feedback, and we will update the theme to accommodate the needs of the community. Please help us to create the best developer's framework possible, and best of all, it will be free... forever.
