{"name":"Whitelabel-framework","tagline":"Whitelabel Framework WordPress Theme (the perfect parent theme)","body":"### A WordPress Developers \"Best Friend\"\r\nThis WordPress theme is a developers framework, also known as a “Parent Theme”. The intention is not to give a bunch of eye candy, instead, the focus is on good a good flexible theme that allows moving fromPSD to WordPress themes in record time.\r\n\r\nBeyond that we have a TON of CMS back-office features, of which we will begin to document after we solidify the beta public release on the WordPress.org repository. If your tired of loading the same plugins over and over on all your sites to make them CMS friendly for clients, your going to LOVE this parent theme.\r\n\r\n- See more at: http://whitelabelframework.com/#sthash.iSW4WObU.dpuf\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nThe theme is very light-weight, and as such we are being careful not to “overload” it with a massive set of options. Also, many of the options can be turned off using “PHP Constants”. Look into the functions.php file to see different parts of the framework you can easily turn off completely (PHP pages won’t even by loaded upon disabled constants). \r\n\r\n- See more at: http://whitelabelframework.com/features/#sthash.16aYWEOl.dpuf\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nCopy the part.theme-config.inc.php file into your child theme and erase everything. That should disable just about everything, allowing you to reference the part theme config file for anything you want to turn back on.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @scarstens, a GitHub username, to generate a link to their profile.
